FTUtils iPhone Utility Code Library
-----------------------------------

The code in FTUtils is common utility code extracted from [Free Time Studios](http://www.freetimestudios.com/) iPhone projects. Currently, there is only one primary utility (`FTAnimation`) and some simple preprocessor macros. Some unit tests exist for the code, but more are needed. The documentation is also still under development.
